## react-native-hermes.map

This SourceMap is one generated by the `react-native` + `hermes` pipeline.
See the `rust-sourcemap` repo for instructions on how to generate it.
Additionally, it was processed by `sentry-cli`, which basically inlines all the `sourceContent`s.

## react-native-metro.js.map

This is the SourceMap as generated by `metro` alone, without running the code through `hermes`.
