//! Primitives for dealing with self-referential data.
//!
//! The types and traits in this module aim to work around the lack of self-referencial types in
//! Rust. This can happen when a _dependent_ type -- one that needs to borrow data without holding
//! on to the owning reference -- needs to be stored alongside its owner. This is inherently not
//! possible in Rust, since it would require the owner to have a stable memory address, but it is
//! moved along with the reference.
//!
//! This module solves this by introducing the `AsSelf` trait, which can be used to coerce the
//! lifetime of a dependent object to the lifetime of its owners at the time of the borrow.
//!
//! See [`SelfCell`] and [`AsSelf`] for more information.

/// Safe downcasting of dependent lifetime bounds on structs.
///
/// This trait is similar to `AsRef`, except that it allows to capture the lifetime of the own
/// instance at the time of the borrow. This allows to force it onto the type's lifetime bounds.
/// This is particularly useful when the type's lifetime is somehow tied to it's own existence, such
/// as in self-referential structs. See [`SelfCell`] for an implementation that makes use of this.
///
/// ## Implementation
///
/// While this trait may be implemented for any type, it is only useful for types that specify a
/// lifetime bound, such as `Cow` or [`ByteView`]. To implement, define `Ref` as the type with all
/// dependent lifetimes set to `'slf`. Then, simply return `self` in `as_self`.
///
/// ```rust
/// # use symbolic_common::AsSelf;
/// struct Foo<'a>(&'a str);
///
/// impl<'slf> AsSelf<'slf> for Foo<'_> {
///     type Ref = Foo<'slf>;
///
///     fn as_self(&'slf self) -> &Self::Ref {
///         self
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Interior Mutability
///
/// **Note** that if your type uses interior mutability (essentially any type from `std::sync`, but
/// specifically everything built on top of `UnsafeCell`), this implicit coercion will not work. The
/// compiler imposes this limitation by declaring any lifetime on such types as invariant, to avoid
/// interior mutations to write back data with the lowered lifetime.
///
/// If you are sure that your type will not borrow and store data of the lower lifetime, then
/// implement the coercion with an unsafe transmute:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use symbolic_common::AsSelf;
/// # use std::cell::UnsafeCell;
/// struct Foo<'a>(UnsafeCell<&'a str>);
///
/// impl<'slf> AsSelf<'slf> for Foo<'_> {
///     type Ref = Foo<'slf>;
///
///     fn as_self(&'slf self) -> &Self::Ref {
///         unsafe { std::mem::transmute(self) }
///     }
/// }
/// ```

/// A container carrying a derived object alongside its owner.

/// **Warning**: This is an inherently unsafe type that builds on top of [`StableDeref`] and
/// [`AsSelf`] to establish somewhat safe memory semantics. Always try to avoid self-references by
/// storing data in an outer scope or avoiding the need alltogether, first.
///
/// `SelfCell` stores an owner object that must implement [`StableDeref`]. This guarantees that the
/// reference pointed to by the dependent object never moves over the lifetime of this object. This
/// is already implemented for most heap-allocating types, like `Box`, `Rc`, `Arc` or `ByteView`.
///
/// Additionally, the dependent object must implement `AsSelf`. This guarantees that the borrow's
/// lifetime and its lifetime bounds never exceed the lifetime of the owner. As such, an object
/// `Foo<'a>` that borrows data from the owner, will be coerced down to `Foo<'self>` when borrowing.
/// There are two constructor functions, `new` and `try_new`, each of which are passed a pointer to
/// the owned data. Dereferencing this pointer is intentionally unsafe, and beware that a borrow of
/// that pointer **must not** leave the callback.
///
/// While it is possible to store derived *references* in a `SelfCell`, too, there are simpler
/// alternatives, such as `owning_ref::OwningRef`. Consider using such types before using
/// `SelfCell`.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # use symbolic_common::{AsSelf, SelfCell};
/// struct Foo<'a>(&'a str);
///
/// impl<'slf> AsSelf<'slf> for Foo<'_> {
///     type Ref = Foo<'slf>;

/// assert_eq!(cell.get().0, "hello world");
