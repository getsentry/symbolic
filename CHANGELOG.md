## 8.3.0

**Features**:

- Write versioned CFI Cache files. Reading those files is only supported with symbolic versions `>= 8.2.1`, so trying to use a CFI Cache file with an older version of symbolic will fail with a `CfiErrorKind::BadFileMagic` error.

**Fixes**:

- Correctly restore callee saves registers when using compact unwind info.
- Correctly map all DWARF information when using BcSymbolMaps.
- Allow processing of PDB files that have broken inlinee file references.
- Skip duplicated DWARF functions which can lead to `inline parent offset` overflows.

## 8.2.1

**Features**:

- Add support for reading versioned CFI Cache files.

**Fixes**:

- Avoid quadratic slowdown when using compact unwind info on macOS.

- [@Gankra](https://github.com/Gankra)

## 8.2.0

**Caution**:

- Relevant dependencies such as `gimli`, `goblim`, and `wasm`-related libraries were updated.

**Features**:

- Support for compact unwind info in MachO files was added, along with special casing of some well known macOS system functions.
- The parser of the Breakpad Format was rewritten.

**Bug Fixes**:

- All valid `STACK WIN` record types are being parsed correctly. This did add new variants to the `BreakpadStackWinRecordType` enum. Technically a _breaking change_, but we do not consider the Breakpad Parser types as adhering to strict SemVer rules.

## 8.1.0

**Features**:

- Add support for loading BCSymbolMaps into MachObjects to un-obfuscate symbol names in bitcode builds. ([#336](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/336))

## 8.0.5

**Bug Fixes**:

## 8.0.4

Manylinux2010 has dropped support for Python 2.7. As a result, we're no longer building or testing the Python package with Python 2.7. This and future releases require at least Python 3.6.

**Bug Fixes**:

- Compute correct line offsets in symcaches with large gaps between line records. ([#319](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/319))
- Support symcache lookups for public symbols larger than 65k. ([#320](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/320))

## 8.0.3

**Bug Fixes**:

- Support DWARF information from MIPS compilers in `SHT_MIPS_DWARF` sections. ([#317](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/317))
- Remove a duplicate dependency to two versions of `walrus` for WASM parsing. ([#312](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/312))

## 8.0.2

**Bug Fixes**:

- Include third-party submodules to allow the Python `sdist` to build again. ([#310](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/310))

## 8.0.1

**Bug Fixes**:

- Compute correct debug identifiers when proessing a Minidump from a machine with opposite endianness. This particularly allows to process MIPS minidumps on little-endian hosts. ([#281](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/281))
- Update the breakpad processor with better stack scanning heuristics. Some false-positive frames are avoided during stack scanning now. ([#281](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/281))
- Avoid panics when processing UE4 crash logs containing ambiguous local times. ([#307](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolic/pull/307))

## 8.0.0

**Breaking Changes**:

- Usage of `failure` was removed, and all error types were changed to only implement `std::error::Error` and related traits.
- `symbolic-proguard` was removed in favor of the `proguard` crate. Proguard is still supported via `symbolic-cabi` and the python API however.
- Deprecated APIs have been removed:
  - `InstructionInfo`'s fields are no longer public.

  - `Unreal4ContextRuntimeProperties::misc_primary_cpu_brand` is has been removed.
- Deprecated Python APIs have been removed:
  - `CodeModule.id` and `CodeModule.name` Use `debug_id` and `code_file`, respectively.
- `DemangleFormat` and public fields of `DemangleOptions` have been removed in favor of builder methods on `DemangleOptions`.
- `Name::new` now takes both the `NameMangling` state, and the `Language` explicitly.

## 6.0.2

- Fix Rust features: The `serde` feature activated minidump and unreal unintentionally. This is
  addressed by providing separate features for modules with serde. See the Readme for more information.
- Include breakpad sources in `symbolic-minidump`.

## 6.0.0

This is a complete rewrite of `symbolic`. The aim of this release is to make the Rust version, the
C-API and the Python package more convenient to use in different scenarios. As a result, there have
been quite a few breaking changes.

**Breaking Changes:**

- `ByteViewHandle` has been replaced with the slightly safer type `SelfCell`. It allows to create a
  self-referential pair of an owning object and a derived object.
- `Archive` and `Object` are the new types to interface with debug information. There are also
  direct types exposed for Breakpad, ELF, MachO, PE and PDB; as well as traits to abstract over
  them.
- `SymCache` has a cleaner API, and the writing part has been moved to `SymCacheWriter`.
- Some common types have received better names: `ObjectKind` is now called `FileFormat`.
  `ObjectClass` is now called `ObjectKind`.
- Many more small signature changes, such as zero-copy return values or iterators instead of
  collections.

**New Features:**

- Initial support for PE and PDB is here. It is not complete yet, and will be expanded over the next
  releases.
- Symbol tables for ELF are now supported. On the bottom line, this will improve symbolication
  results on Linux.
- GNU-style compressed debug information (e.g. `.zdebug_info`) is now supported.
- Support for most of DWARF 5, thanks to the amazing work on the `gimli` crate.
- More lenient parsing of Breakpad symbols now handles certain edge cases more gracefully and gives
  much better error messages.
- More utilities to join or split paths from any platform.

**Bug Fixes:**

- Fix invalid function name resolution for certain DWARF files.
- Fix errors on DWARF files generated with LTO.
- Fix memory leaks when processing Minidumps from Python.
- Skip STAB symbol entries in MachO files, potentially leading to wrong function names.
- Do not error on "negative" line numbers in Breakpad symbols.

**Internal Changes:**

- Greatly simplified build process and better documentation for the C library.
- Improved test suite, docs and READMEs. While there can never be enough tests, this is a
  significant step to improving the overall quality of symbolic.
- Automatic cloning of submodules during the build. This should make it easier to start developing
  on `symbolic`.
