# Symbolic C-ABI

This package contains the C-ABI of symbolic. It builds a C header file and associated library that
can be linked to any C or C++ program. Note that the header is C only. Primarily, this package is
meant to be consumed by higher-level wrappers in other languages, such as the
[`symbolic`](https://pypi.org/project/symbolic/) Python package.

## Building

Building the dynamic library has the same requirements as building the `symbolic` crate:

- Latest stable Rust and Cargo
- A C++14 compiler
- A checkout of this repository and all its GIT submodules.

To build, run `make release` in this directory. This creates a release build of the dynamic library
in `cabi/target/release/libsymbolic.*`.

## Usage

The header comes packaged in the `include/` directory. It does not have any dependencies other than
standard C headers. Then, include it in sources and use like this:

```c
#include "symbolic.h"

int main() {
    SymbolicStr mangled = symbolic_str_from_cstr("_ZNSt11char_traitsIcE6assignERcRKc");
    SymbolicStr demangled = symbolic_demangle(&mangled, /* language */ 0);
    if (demangled.len) {
        printf("demangled: %.*s\n", (int)demangled.len, demangled.data);
    } else {
        print("demangling failed.");
    }

    symbolic_str_free(&demangled);
    return 0;
}
```

In your application, point to the symbolic include directory and specify the symbolic library:

```bash
$(CC) -Isymbolic/cabi/include -Lsymbolic/cabi/target/release -lsymbolic -o myprogram main.c
```

## Development

### Requirements

In addition to the build requirements, development requires a recent _Rust nightly_ toolchain and
the `cbindgen` tool. To set this up, run:

```bash
rustup toolchain add nightly
cargo install cbindgen
```

If your machine already has `cbindgen` installed, check the header of [`include/symbolic.h`] for the
minimum version required. This can be verified by running `cbindgen --version`. It is generally
advisable to keep `cbindgen` updated to its latest version, and always check in cbindgen updates
separate from changes to the public interface.

### Makefile

This package contains the Rust crate `symbolic_cabi` that exposes a public FFI interface. There are
additional build steps involved in generating the header file located at `include/symbolic.h`. To
aid development, there is a _Makefile_ that exposes all relevant commands for building:

- `make build`: Builds the library using `cargo`.
- `make header`: Updates the header file based on the public interface of `symbolic_cabi`.
- `make test`: Runs a small integration test that verifies that the library builds and links.
- `make clean`: Removes all build artifacts but leaves the header.
- `make`: Builds the library, the header, and runs tests.

For ease of development, the header is always checked into the repository. After making changes, do
not forget to run at least `make header` to ensure the header is in sync with the library.

### Development Flow

1. Make changes to the `symbolic` crates and add tests.
2. Update `symbolic_cabi` and add, remove or update functions as needed.
3. Regenerate the header and run tests by running `make test` in the `cabi/` directory.
4. Go to the Python package in the `py/` folder and update the high-level wrappers.
5. Consider whether this changeset requires a major version bump.

The general rule for major versions is:

- If everything is backward compatible, do **not major** bump.
- If the C interface breaks compatibility but high-level wrappers are still backwards compatible, do
  **not major** bump. The C interface is currently viewed as an implementation detail.
- If high-level wrappers are no longer backwards compatible or there are breaking changes in the
  `symbolic` crate itself, **do major** bump.
